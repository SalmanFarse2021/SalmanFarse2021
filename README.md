# 👋 Hi, I'm Md Salman Farse

I’m a **Computer Science undergraduate at The University of Texas at Arlington** with a strong interest in **Software Engineering, AI Systems, and Applied Machine Learning**. I enjoy building scalable, real-world systems where **software meets intelligent decision-making**.

I’m particularly interested in how traditional software engineering is evolving into **AI-native systems**, and I actively work at the intersection of **backend engineering, distributed systems, and AI-powered applications**.

---

## 🧠 What I Work On

- **Full-stack applications** (Web & Mobile)
- **AI-powered systems** (LLMs, agents, automation)
- **Real-time platforms** (feeds, messaging, live updates)
- **Scalable backend services** (APIs, queues, databases)
- **Privacy-first and ethical system design**
